My name is <name> and I live in <country>. One day I'd like to travel to <country> because I've never seen a <animal> and I read that they have <adjective>, <adjective> ones there. However, because <number> <color>, <adjective> <noun>s make it difficult to travel, I may have to travel to <country> instead. That would be ok, but might take <number> <timeframe>s to get there.
